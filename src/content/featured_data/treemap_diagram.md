A simple treemap diagram constructed using D3.js, HTML, CSS, and javascript. This particular treemap is one example of many, on how D3.js can be used for data visualization and presentation. The manipulated data was for three seperate datsets (Kickstarter Pledges, Movie Sales, and Video-Game Sales), all being in JSON format.
