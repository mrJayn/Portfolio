Choropleth maps are made extremely easy with D3.js and are a great option for dynamic (and fun) data visualization. Unlike a heat-map, this choropleth is a thematic map that uses color to correspond with an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic such as population density or per-capita income, and in this case, educational rates.

This project is a great example of what D3.js can be accomodating for, especially in regards to data visualization of a much larger scale. This particular project was created for a certification project provided by FreeCodeCamp, in early 2021.
