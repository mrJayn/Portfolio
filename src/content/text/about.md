introduction: I'm an chemical engineer turned developer who wants nothing more than to consume knowledge and to find the problems yet to to have a solution. I started teaching myself how to practically code in early March of 2022 and seeing how far I've come only gets me more excited for what lies ahead. I'm exeptionally well versed in Javascript Front End development, Python and SQL data analysis.

### My Passion

During college, I began working out religiously and, being an engineer, built my workouts primarily based around exercise physiology and Kinesiology (which admittedly is a bit nerdy). So, in order to incorporate particular programs and principles, I created a simple "excel" spreadsheet using Google sheets, to manage a few things. Well... "a few things" may have accidently turned into a fully functioning app. This "sheet-app", in unison with Google API and Google Scripts, had me accidently writing HTML, CSS, and Jquery before I even knew their names.

And one day, while adding yet another function, it dawned on me... I really love doing this kind of stuff. After my first certificate and way too many leetcode problems, I made the decision to get started. I began learning, building and challenging myself in new ways each and every day, and so far, I'm only getting more excited about what lies ahead.
