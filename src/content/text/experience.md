As for real-world jobs...well... I've never had a real one... that is in regards to software, coding or development. BUT ! I did work an internship at Rochester Electronics, the worlds single largest conitnuous provider of semiconductors. While I was employed ( as an intern ) I was responsible for gathering data on ideal conditions for a new method of electroplating ( AKA electrodeposition ) in a nickel/tin alloy bath. And well... I finished REALLY early, so they decided to make me do a multitude of tasks, one being writing a simple brute-force macro to transfer data from a particular program into excel. So I guees I did manage to get a bit of relavant experience!

But, it's safe to say that on a piece of paper, I look like a bit of a deadbeat ( in my own opinion ). However, I can at least justify the last 4... maybe 5 years of my life being spent on trying to further my education. And the past 6 months alone, strictly to coding. And I say coding because I've touched briefly on so many subjects. And towards the end of the past few months I've managed to narrow my sights down and get particularly knowledgable with just a few.

So in conclusion, I do have my certifications, however if anything is to speak for my acquired knowledge, it'd have to be this portfolio alone. At least considering, that this is my first ever website.

So please, if you did manage to read all that, I appreciate it and would love for you to have a look at some of the small projects I've managed to piece together!
