My early years were by no means difficult. Having a healthy functioning family with hard-working parents, helped me to attend private insitutions until the 7th grade before attending public schools.</p>\n<p>My interests for problem solving began as early as I can remember, however my first interactions with some type of development came in 8th grade in CAD design course, and again sophmore year of highschool in a Robotics course both being suprelative courses with no more than 10 kids in each class. In hindsight, attending these classes were always the highlight of my day.</p>\n<h3>Education</h3>\n<p>I applied to many prestigous colleges, however very few offered scholarships, and the few that did, seemed unimpactful, except for one. The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered free tuition and with the in-state-resident fees, this was my new home for the next 4 years. I chose to persue a chemical engineering degree, not quite knowing which direction I was headed in life, only knowing that this was considered to be the most difficult engineering major.</p>\n<p>I struggled in the begining, adjusting to the new way of life and over time I learned a lot about myself. I began attending less of my classes and begain studying directly from the source material seeing as I could save myself ALOT of time. This practive was not loved by all and came back to bite me in my final year. A required art suprelative course, in my cases \"The history of Jazz\", had a professor who failed me (albeit I hadn't scored less than a 100% on any exam) due to my attendance, or should I say absence, and forced me to remain an undergaduate student for one extra semester.</p>\n<p>After graduation, I still felt uncertain about what lie ahead. My 4 years of engineering were interesting, but after a few internships and seeing what work was really like, I was uninspired. I took time to really think and plan what was next. And with that I set my sights on a discipline in a pharmaceutical based field. I spent the next year taking pre-requisite courses to attend MCPHS (Mass. School of Pharmacy), all while working full time as a pharmacy technician and covid-19 PCR test administrator. During that time, I felt unchallenged by what seemed like, tedious, rather than intellectually demanding tasks, and once again, concluded that this profession wasn't right for me.</p>\n<h3>Realization</h3>\n<p>And then it dawned on me, while adding another function to a google sheet I had been using religously for the past couple of years, that I may have accidentally created an entirely functioning app from google sheets alone. This \"sheet-app\" managed the entirety of my workouts, including displaying daily workouts, updating program statistics daily, and even going as far as tracking precise muscles that may be \"over-worked\" from too much direct work (and this was before I knew about web-scraping so every muscles data was enter in manually on another document). And somewhere along the way I stumbled into Google API and Google Scripts, which accidently had me writing HTML and Javascript before I knew it's name.</p>\n<p>At this realization, that my small hobby may actually be a profittable and exciting profession, I not only took up the challenge to begin building not only my knowledge and undestanding of developement, but my career as well.</p>\n"},"experience":{"folder":"text","id":"experience","data":{"sectionName":"Experience","title":"My Experience","subtitle":"Where I've worked.<br/>What I've accomplished.","description":"My past professional statement, job history, and education.","src":"/assets/misc/resume2022.jpg","alt":"/","slug":"experience","education":{"university":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","degree":"B.S. in Chemical Engineering","dates":"September 2015 -
