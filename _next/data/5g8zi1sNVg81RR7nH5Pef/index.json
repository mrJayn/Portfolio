My early years were by no means difficult, having a happy, healthy, and loving family with hard working parents.</p>\n<p>My interests for problem solving began as early as I can remember. Legos were my first step, as for many, however my creativity often didn't stop on the last page of the instruction manual. I would destroy these pre-concieve designs and use the pieces to build my own creations, ussually modeled after games I'd play in my adolescense.</p>\n<p>As coding went, my first and most impactful memory of using coputing to solve problems occured in 2008. At age 12-13 I had stumbled across a flash-based physics game called \"Fantastic Contraption\". I remeber loving this game so much! I would dig into the code to learn ways to create my own stuff using coordinate grids and very simple code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/misc/fantasticContraption.jpg\" alt=\"Screen Shot of Fantastic Contraption\"></p>\n<p>Unlike today, back in the 2000s coding and computational problem solving was not so readily available in school or any acedmic setting before university. However, lukily, my highschool offered a few computer courses, and I took them all. Those courses revolved around CAD design, Robotics (using Lego Mindstorm), and Adobe Animation. These courses never had more than 10-15 kids enrolled in each of them but, in hindsight, these courses to me, were always the highlight of my day.</p>\n<p>It dawned on me that writing code may actually be my end all be all I a bit of a strange way. During college I began working out religously and being an engineer, deconstucted and rebuilt my workouts from the foundation up, which admittingly is a bit nerdy. I used google sheets to manage almost the entirety of my workouts and thier data. These sheets displayed daily workouts, updated programmed exercises daily, and even went as far as tracking precise muscles that may have been \"over-worked\" and recommended adjustments that could be made. Somewhere along the way I stumbled into Google API and Google Scripts, which accidently had me writing HTML and Javascript before I knew it's name. And while adding yet another feature, I realized I may have accidentally created an entirely functioning app from google sheets alone.</p>\n<p>At this realization that my small hobby might just be the profession I'd been searching for. The profession that I'd want to wake up for every morning for. The profession that I could truly come to love. And so, I got started on a logn road, and challenged myself to not only begin building my knowledge, but my career as well.</p>\n"},"experience":{"folder":"text","id":"experience","data":{"id":"experience","title":"My Experience","subtitle":"Where I've worked.<br/>What I've accomplished.","description":"My past professional statement, job history, and education.","src":"/assets/misc/resume2022.jpg","alt":"/","education":{"university":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","degree":"B.S. in Chemical Engineering","dates":"September 2015 -
