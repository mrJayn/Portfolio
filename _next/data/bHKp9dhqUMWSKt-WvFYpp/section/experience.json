While employed there, I mainly conducted batch experiments, collected data, analyzed said data, and communicated the results, the statistical models, and further recommendations moving ahead.","More specifically, I conducted small-scale experiments revolving an electroplating process using a Nickel/Tin based solution. This process was due to be implemented in the near future and required addittional assessment of ideal conditions, some of which being: electrical current across the anode/electrode through the chemical solution, agitation rate of parts during deposition, and correct concentrations to produced the desired deposition thickness. My  experiments and research data helped the department to begin full scale implementation.","Some more curious of the duties I carried out on a daily basis included - quality assurance using XRF (X-ray fluorescence) - tensile calibration for silicon die baking-clips - Creation of simple brute-force macros in VBA, that transfered data from a particular intruments API to excel.
