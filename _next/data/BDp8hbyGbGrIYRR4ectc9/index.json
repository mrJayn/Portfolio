So, in order to incorporate particular programs and principles, I created a simple \"excel\" spreadsheet using Google sheets, to manage a few things. Well... \"a few things\" may have accidently turned into a fully functioning app. This \"sheet-app\", in unison with Google API and Google Scripts, had me accidently writing HTML, CSS, and Jquery before I even knew their names.</p>\n<p>And one day, while adding yet another function, it dawned on me... I really love doing this kind of stuff. After my first certificate and way too many leetcode problems, I made the decision to get started. I began learning, building and challenging myself in new ways each and every day, and so far, I'm only getting more excited about what lies ahead.</p>\n"},"experience":{"folder":"text","id":"experience","data":{"id":"experience","title":"Experience","subtitle":"Work History and <br/> Achievements","description":"My Past Work Experience, Education, and Certifications","src":"/assets/misc/resume2022.jpg","alt":"/","education":{"university":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","degree":"B.S. in Chemical Engineering","dates":"September 2015 -
